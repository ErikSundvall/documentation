When you want to build the documentation locally, we recommend to use the latest version of Sphinx. Download from http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

Installation should be straight forward.

After successful installation, add also the HTML Domain by executing: `pip install sphinxcontrib-httpdomain`

To build the project (for example as html pages), type:

`make html`
