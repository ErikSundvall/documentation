General Features
****************

- openEHR Reference Model Version 1.0.4
- Serialisation of Reference Model Objects in Canonical JSON and XML 
- Archetype Definition Language 1.4
- Data Validation against Operational Templates
- openEHR REST API Endpoints (see below for details)


openEHR REST API 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Based on the `official openEHR REST API <https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/ITS-REST/latest/>`_ the following endpoints are implemented:

- EHR (CREATE EHR, CREATE EHR with Id)
- EHR_STATUS
- COMPOSITION (Create, Update, Delete, Get Composition by Version Id, Get composition at time)
- CONTRIBUTION (Create, Get of compositions. Other versioned object like EHR_STATUS coming soonly)
- DIRECTORY (Create, Update, Delete, Get folder in directory version, get folder in directory version at time)
- QUERY (Execute ad-hoc (non-stored) AQL Query, Execute stored query, parameters))
- STORED_QUERY (List Stored Queries, Store a query, Get stored query, delete, parameters)
- ADL 1.4 TEMPLATE (Upload a Template, List Templates, Get Template)

.. note::  The Swagger UI is generally WIP and currently does not distinguish between implemented endpoints and stubs! This means that you will see some endpoints that you cannot use)

.. note::  The data format for contributions sent through the REST API is not yet defined in the openEHR. Please refer to the examples. Also note that the format might be subject of change.   

Conformance Tests 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

EHRbase ships with a set of tests verifying the conformance with the openEHR REST API. For now the tests include the following endpoints: 

- EHR
- EHR_STATUS
- COMPOSITION
- CONTRIBUTION
- ADL 1.4 TEMPLATE
- DIRECTORY
- QUERY


What (basic) features you might miss
************************************
- VERSIONED_OBJECT Endpoints are not implemented
- EHR functions like is_modifyable and is_queryable are not yet supported

Known Issues
************

As EHRbase is still in alpha status, there are plenty of known issues. If you try things out, please be aware that the 
following issues are known and documented: 

Archetype Query Language 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ehr e projection not supported

- Not supported variables in archetype_id predicates

.. code-block:: sql

   select e/ehr_id/value, e/time_created/value, e/system_id/value from EHR 
   e CONTAINS COMPOSITION c [$archetype_id]
   
- TIMEWINDOW keyword is not supported

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT e/ehr_id/value FROM EHR e TIMEWINDOW PT12H/2019-10-24
